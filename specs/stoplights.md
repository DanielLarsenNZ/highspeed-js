# STOPLIGHTS

> http://pinball.org/rules/highspeed.html

> _Thanks to Bill Ung._

> The main stoplight is located above the opening to the ramp. You begin with a 
> green light. Around the board are three sets of stoplights lights with red, 
> yellow and green targets. 

> The game begins with a green light. 

> Each light begins with its light flashing on each of the three stoplight targets. 

> Complete each light by spotting each flashing target by hitting it with the ball, 
> or using the ramp (see RAMP SHOTS) or the eject hole (see EJECT HOLE). 

> When the all targets of the current light have been spotted, the light is advanced 
> to yellow, then to red. 

> When you reach the red light. You must now send the ball up the ramp to begin the 
> police chase. This can either be done from the playfield or off of the plunger. 

> During the police chase, spot all nine stoplight targets in any order to light 
> the "Escape" lamp at the eject hole. 

> During Multi-Ball and *after* scoring a jackpot, all nine target lights may again 
> be spotted in any order to light the Extra Ball. Ramp shots and the eject hole will 
> not help you here. 

> Whenever a stoplight is spotted, the game adds 1,000 points to your bonus total 
> (see BONUS POINTS).


## Spotting the stoplights

> The three traffic lights around the board can be hit/marked (spotted) in the following ways:

> * Hitting the target next to the light with the ball.
> * Sending the ball up the ramp. Each ramp shot will spot a stoplight target and 
>   advance the current light, if necessary. <sup>1</sup>
> * Landing the ball in the eject hole (see EJECT HOLE). <sup>2</sup>

> <sup>1</sup> Depending upon the difficulty setting, you may or may not be awarded a stoplight 
> target for a plunger ramp shot. 3-ball settings typically do, 5-ball settings typically don't.

> <sup>2</sup> Depending upon the difficulty setting, this feature may be disabled. 3-ball 
> settings typically do, 5-ball settings typically don't.

> If the game has a choice, it will always spot the lower bank targets first, then 
> the upper bank targets, and finally the center bank targets. 

> If more than one target is valid on a bank, the game will spot the red first, yellow 
> second and green last.


### Making a Stoplight Target.

> Make Stoplight Targets to change Ramp Stoplight from Green to Yellow to Red.
  
> | Stoplight status  | Count of other (same colour) Targets made | Action       |

When Stoplight Target is hit, if it is not made, make Target. 

When Stoplight Target is made, light target, add 1000 Bonus Points, sound stoplight-target.wav.

When Stoplight Target is made, if all Stoplight Targets are made, advance Ramp Stoplight.
